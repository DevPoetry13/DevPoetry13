- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevPoetry13
- 👀 I’m a Freelance and Senior Developer and I'm interested in **AI**, **Software Development**, and lately **Product Ownership**
- 🌱 I had opportunities to play and experiment with **C**, **C++** and and **Javascript** among many others development languages, librairies and frameworks. A while ago I gained a new interest in **Python** and I’m currently *sharpening my sword* by following a course @ Udemy titled :
     <h4>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022</h4> (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects related to AI and Financial Analysis to mention only these, with a neat preference for back-end.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Leave a message under this commit !
